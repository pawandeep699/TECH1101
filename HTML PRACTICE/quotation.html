  <blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"> JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a 
     programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
     and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-base object-orientation, and first-class functions.
     Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript enables interactive 
     web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,
     [9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</blockquote>
